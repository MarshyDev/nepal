    <p>Hello! I made this website to tell you about my trip to Nepal!</p>
    <p>So, lets start.</p>
    <p>To get there, it was a LOOOOOOONG flight. But after that BOOOOOORRRRIIIIINNNNGGG trip, I was (obiously) hungry. So I went to get some food. I found a resturaunt (and totally didn't have to use google translate to speak!!!!) and got a seat. I ordered the Dal Bhat, a  d e l i c i o u s  food. And after i finished, went sight-seeing. The landscape was beautiful! So i took a picture, and put it here:</p>
    <div id="ls1"></div>
    <p>as you can see, it is a wonderful place.</p>
